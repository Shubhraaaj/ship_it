# Shipit

The advent of on-demand applications has redefined customer convenience. The Courier
delivery industry has transformed due to the repercussions of on-demand services. And to do
that you would require an advanced courier & parcel delivery application that consists of all the
cutting-edge features. Shipit offers a convenient way to track your packages from various vendors in real time: from the moment they are registered in the system (by the carrier or by the user) and up to the moment they reach their destination and are delivered to the address. It also provides the vendor partners an efficient way to manage orders, generate reports, and update order statuses.

     1. Frontend React: React, Apollo Client, RxJS, Framer Motion, Tailwind css, Recharts
     2. Backend NestJS, TypeORM,
